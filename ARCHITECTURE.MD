# dChange Architecture

dChange is built using a modular, decentralized architecture to ensure high performance, scalability, and security. Below are the key components that form the dChange system.

## Key Components

### 1. **Frontend (PWA)**
- The user interface is developed using **Flutter** for a responsive Progressive Web App (PWA) experience.
- It allows users to manage their digital wallets, exchange assets, and interact with smart contracts.

### 2. **Backend**
- The backend is a server-less design, where **decentralized protocols** handle most operations.
- Smart contracts deployed on the blockchain execute trade logic and handle transactions.

### 3. **Blockchain Layer**
- The blockchain ensures transparency and security for all asset transfers and exchanges.
- Smart contracts are stored on-chain to manage trades, settlements, and fees.

The architecture is designed for high modularity, allowing easy updates and new feature integration.
